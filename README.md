🧩 Microservices To-Do App
This is a full-stack web application demonstrating a scalable architecture using microservices, JWT authentication, Docker, and a modern React frontend.

🛠️ Project Overview
Users can register and log in securely, then create and view personal tasks. Authentication and task management are handled by separate microservices.

📦 Architecture
Frontend: Built with Next.js 14 App Router and Tailwind CSS

API Gateway: Routes requests to backend services using Flask

Auth Service: Handles registration, login, and token verification with JWT

Task Service: Manages user-created tasks with secure authentication

Docker: All services are containerized and orchestrated using Docker Compose

🔐 Authentication
Users log in and receive a JWT, which is stored in localStorage on the frontend and included in each authorized request. The token is verified by the auth service.

Register and login use /auth/register and /auth/login via the API Gateway

JWT is attached to requests to the task service through the API Gateway
